# Pystation

## Config
You can set your own default profile by creating a `conf.ini` file in the `config` folder. An example configure file is 
provided.

The default `idle.mp3` is a silent file that will play when the player is idling i.e. there is no track playing or 
queued. You can change the `idle.mp3` file to any other tagless mp3.
